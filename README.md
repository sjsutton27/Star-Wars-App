# Star-Wars-App
The App is called Jocasta, the name based off of the Librarian Jedi. She holds all the knowledge known in the Star Wars Universe. Our Star Wars app was a group project, we were split into two teams front end and back end. My contribution was to the back-end, I performed the API call for Star War's starships and vehicles.
The App was made in Android using Jetpack Compose, the API we used is https://swapi.dev/
Data has the images for each character, film, planet, species, starship, and vehicle.
